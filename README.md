This project is a fully funcional food ordering system made in django.
Beside python I did use bootstrap 4 for better control of all DOMs elements.
No javascript has been used.


index.hmlt login.html signin.html menu.html extends layout.html file 
my_orders.html and orders_manager shows list of all orders
models.py contain all data structures
urls.py contain routes to functions
views.py cotain main program and fuctions which renders html files

Also in static folder there are pictures and style.css file which contain additional styling for html 

Program automatically create superuser account at first start

My personal touch allowing site administrator to mark orders as complete and allowing users to see the status of their pending or completed orders
